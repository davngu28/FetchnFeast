### Steps to Run the App

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Xcode
3. Select the desired simulator and run the app

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

I focused on implementing a clean architecture by separating the view, logic, and network layers, adhering to the MVVM pattern to promote maintainable and testable code. Additionally, I prioritized user experience by ensuring smooth and intuitive UI interactions. Features such as pull-to-refresh, search, and filtering were thoughtfully integrated to enhance the app's functionality and make it feel more like a dedicated recipe app. These two areas are, in my opinion, the foundation of a well-designed and high-performing application. A great architecture ensures readability and scalability, while delivering an exceptional user experience should always be the top priority for any app developer.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

The project took approximately 5 hours to complete. I dedicated the first 15 to 30 minutes to planning and outlining the UI components and core functions, as well as thoroughly reading the problem statement to ensure a clear understanding of the requirements. Around 30 minutes to an hour was spent developing the UI, focusing on creating a clean and intuitive interface. The bulk of the time, about three hours, was allocated to implementing and handling data fetching from the API endpoint. Finally, I spent an additional hour testing the app under various scenarios, including different API responses and internet speeds, to ensure the app functioned as intended in every odd case.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

I opted to spend the majority of my time on core logic and testing rather than fine-tuning the UI design, which resulted in static colors and fonts for simplicity and an overall design that lacks character instead of dynamic styling.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

As aforementioned, I believe the weakest part of my project is the UI design. The UI was implemented to function as required by the project, but there is no life or character to it. I usually pride myself on being a creative visionary, and designing applications to match the aesthetic of its purpose is one of the more appealing problems to tackle in coding to me, but this is something I had to sacrifice for the sake of time.

### External Code and Dependencies: Did you use any external code, libraries, or dependencies?

No, I did not use any external code, libraries, or dependencies.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.

First and foremost, I would like to thank Fetch for the opportunity. Working on this project has been an excellent learning experience, allowing me to reinforce key SwiftUI concepts and skills. I would also like to apologize for the delayed submission, as I found the initial e-mail for this take-home project in my promotions folder weeks later than intended, and I hope this does not impact your consideration. Thank you once again, and I look forward to hearing back from you!
